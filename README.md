## Features
- **Real-time ASCII Art:** AsciiVision captures video from your webcam and converts it into ASCII characters, providing a dynamic and interactive visual output.
- **Customizable Color Schemes:** Experiment with different color schemes such as black and white or vibrant green text on a black background to tailor the visual aesthetic to your liking.
- **Interactive Controls:** AsciiVision offers intuitive controls to start or pause the webcam feed and toggle between various color schemes, empowering users to actively engage with the artwork they create.
- **Inverted Colors:** Explore the impact of inverted colors on the ASCII art, altering its appearance and revealing new layers of visual complexity.

## How It Works
AsciiVision leverages the Camera API to access your device's webcam, enabling seamless integration between the physical world and digital art creation. Through JavaScript, each pixel's brightness is mapped to a corresponding ASCII character, offering a real-time interpretation of the captured video feed. This synthesis of human-computer interaction and creative coding results in an immersive and engaging user experience.

## Usage
To unleash your creativity with AsciiVision, simply open the webpage in a compatible browser and grant permission to access your webcam. Once the webcam feed is initiated, you can interact with the controls to adjust color schemes, invert colors, and pause/resume the ASCII art generation process. Experiment with different settings to discover unique visual compositions and share your creations with others.

## Functionalities
AsciiVision offers a range of interactive functionalities designed to enhance the user experience and encourage creative exploration:

- **Real-time ASCII Art Generation:** AsciiVision captures live video from your webcam and converts it into ASCII art in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback and enabling dynamic artistic expression.
- **Customizable Color Schemes:** Users can choose from a selection of predefined color schemes, including classic black and white or vivid green text on a black background. This customization feature allows individuals to tailor the visual style of the ASCII art to suit their preferences and artistic vision.
